-- push is a library that will allow us to draw our game at a virtual
-- resolution, instead of however large our window is; used to provide
-- a more retro aesthetic

-- the "Class" library we're using will allow us to represent anything in
-- our game as code, rather than keeping track of many disparate variables and
-- methods
Class = require 'class'
-- our Paddle class, which stores position and dimensions for each Paddle
-- and the logic for rendering them
require 'Paddle'
-- our Ball class, which isn't much different than a Paddle structure-wise
-- but which will mechanically function very differently
require 'Ball'

-- size of our actual window

    -- means there will be no filtering of pixels (blurriness), which is
    -- important for a nice crisp, 2D look
